This repo has the starter code and completed source code for [this tutorial](https://blog.thegnar.co/react-native-animated) on React Native animations.

## Installing the starter app

To get started, clone the `starter` branch from this project's Github repo, install all dependencies, and start the app:

```bash
git clone -b starter https://github.com/TheGnarCo/animation-tutorial.git
cd animation-tutorial
npm install
react-native run-ios
```

The starter app should have a the wheel and pointer on the screen, but it doesn't do anything quite yet.
Follow along with the tutorial to get your animations up to speed!

## Installing the finished product

To install the completed app, the steps are almost exactly the same, except you should clone from `master`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheGnarCo/animation-tutorial.git
cd animation-tutorial
npm install
react-native run-ios
```
